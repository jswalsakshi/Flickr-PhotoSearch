# Flickr-PhotoSearch

Flickr PhotoSearch is a small app to search images using Flickr API,
# API documentation:
https://www.flickr.com/services/api/explore/flickr.photos.search

# Keypoints:
I thoroughly used my knowledge for the given project, so that App should be more user friendly and responsive. Some of the key knowledge I used are:

Used ARC to Manage Memory of the app.

Used a reuseIdentifier where appropriate

Avoid the Fat XIBs and used storyboard instead.

Not Blocked the Main Thread instead thoroughly used the GCD where required.

Choose the correct Collection for storing data.

Cached the image for great user experience and data saving.

Handle Memory Warnings and avoid retain cycle while using the class.

Please provide me the feedback, it would be very helpful for me.
